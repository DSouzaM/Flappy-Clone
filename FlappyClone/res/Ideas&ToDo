Ideas:


have a COLLISION_TOLERANCE constant to allow some leeway in collisions.
easy mode / hard mode - different gap size + hit tolerance + lives

remember the nextSprite() command
different wall images (fishing hook w/ boat, seaweed, anemone, coral, bird talons, etc)

add states for menu: 
running - walls update and everything, fish going, background going, shows lives and score

not running - shows retry window with no walls, fish and background going, shows final score and high scores. option to toggle hard and easy modes with a key
