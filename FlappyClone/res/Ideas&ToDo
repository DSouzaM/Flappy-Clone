Ideas:


have a COLLISION_TOLERANCE constant to allow some leeway in collisions.
easy mode / hard mode - different gap size + hit tolerance + lives

remember the nextSprite() command
different wall images (fishing hook w/ boat, seaweed, anemone, coral, bird talons, etc)

add states for menu: 
running - walls update and everything, fish going, background going, shows lives and score

not running - shows retry window with no walls, fish and background going, shows final score and high scores. option to toggle hard and easy modes with a key

Next Steps: 
add text file with high scores, have that displayed in END state. add code to overwrite high scores & code to avoid hitting space to restart immediately after losing
work on different sprites for walls and an enum to include their varied filenames and frames per sprite, random generator for said walls
work on different background elements
work on sound
work on alternate sprites/sounds for MLG mode
add code to switch between modes (toggle with M)
